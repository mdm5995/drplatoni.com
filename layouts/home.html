						Drs. Scurfield and Platoni literally “wrote the books” on war trauma. Their writings of war trauma, from both military and civilian sectors, address the specific needs of warrior communities, as well as wider issues such as battle-mind, reintegration and homecoming, survivor guilt, and military and Veteran suicides.
