The man convicted of killing 13 soldiers and injuring more than 30 at Fort Hood in 2009, Nidal Hasan, could soon be executed after his final legal challenge was rejected in April 2025. Survivor Julia Wilson, who was nine months pregnant during the shooting, says she's "100%" hoping they execute Hasan and supports bringing him back to Texas for the execution.

- **Nidal Hasan faces execution:** The convicted Fort Hood shooter who killed 13 soldiers and injured 32 others in 2009 could soon be put to death after his final legal challenge was rejected in April 2025.
- **Survivor supports execution:** Julia Wilson, who was nine months pregnant during the shooting, says she's "100%" hoping they execute Hasan and bring him back to Texas to do it.
- **Classification dispute:** The shooting is still considered "workplace violence" rather than terrorism, which survivors say has prevented victims' families from receiving proper benefits.
- **Historic execution:** If carried out, this would be the first military execution in 60 years, with U.S. War Secretary Pete Hegseth committed to ensuring the death penalty proceeds.
