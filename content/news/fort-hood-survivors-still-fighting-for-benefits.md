## Fort Hood Massacre

## Judicial Watch Defends "The Forgotten Soldier"

{{< youtube -R5rYRB9c00 >}}

This is the first installment, we hope, of a full exposé and a much larger story — the real truths behind the Fort Hood Massacre.

Mr. Howard Berry and I have labored unceasingly to obtain the long overdue recognition deserved by the victims and the benefits due them and their families. The manipulation of the facts surrounding this event is a blot on our country's honor and must be redressed.

Judicial Watch was helping in this mission, but this is now on hold due to funding issues. Here is a 9-minute video highlighting the case of one of the casualties. (I am a survivor of the Fort Hood Massacre.) I hope that you will view this 9-minute documentary and pass it on to others so that they will be sufficiently compelled to join us in demanding justice for those who gave and continue to give the last full measure of devotion to our country.

While this national tragedy occurred 8 years ago, medical disability payments are still being denied the wounded because the shooter, Nidal Hasan, is not deemed an enemy of the state and the Fort Hood Massacre is not considered an act of domestic terrorism. There have been 6 suicides, per Mr. Berry, among the wounded and the survivors, including his beloved son.

Throughout the course of the last 5 years, I have contacted and implored 19 Congresspersons for assistance and intervention on behalf of the wounded and the families of the fallen — and all of them have failed to respond to our pleas. Mr. Berry has personally contacted every single elected official in this great United States, but to no avail. Many actually slammed their doors in his face. This is purely contemptible.

Though the Purple Heart Medal was awarded to the 33 Soldiers and 13 KIA in 2015, the requisite benefits that accompany the Purple Heart have not. Furthermore, those who received other than gunshot wounds received nothing.

Please take a few minutes to watch this documentary and join us in taking action, whether active duty military, reserve forces, National Guard, civilian, or simply interested in the pursuit of justice for the many victims of this tragedy.
