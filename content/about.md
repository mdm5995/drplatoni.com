# Dr. Kathy Platoni — Author

## War Trauma and Its Wake: *Expanding the Circle of Healing*

**Treating trauma survivors**

This book is especially relevant for professionals working with veterans and active-duty military personnel. The editors — one a Vietnam veteran and the other an Army Reserve psychologist with four deployments — have created a work that addresses both specific warrior communities and broader issues such as battlemind, guilt, suicide, and more. The depth of understanding from contributors makes *War Trauma and Its Wake* a crucial resource for understanding the military experience and essential for anyone committed to healing war trauma.

    text="Drs Scurfield and Platoni...are rare professional hybrids; they both served as officers deep inside their respective ground wars and then subsequently reached a level of clinical professionalism few attain. As such, they are fluent in both military and clinical speak, and can therefore serve as translators across that great divide."
