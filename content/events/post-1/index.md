## Test Post #1

**Treating trauma survivors**

This book is especially relevant for professionals working with veterans and active-duty military personnel. The editors — one a Vietnam veteran and the other an Army Reserve psychologist with four deployments — have created a work that addresses both specific warrior communities and broader issues such as battlemind, guilt, suicide, and more. The depth of understanding from contributors makes *War Trauma and Its Wake* a crucial resource for understanding the military experience and essential for anyone committed to healing war trauma.

As such, they are fluent in both military and clinical speak, and can therefore serve as translators across that great divide."

Just as war fighters prepare for engagement by studying their tactics, techniques, and procedures, this authoritative, accurate, and well-written resource informs and changes the way mental health practitioners and others think about assessing, treating, and healing service members and veterans."
